# Simple Text-Based Chatbot

This Python script demonstrates the creation of a basic text-based chatbot. The chatbot responds to user input with predefined greetings and responses.

## Usage

1. The chatbot recognizes and responds to greetings like "hello," "hi," "hey," "greetings," and "howdy."

2. It also responds to questions such as "how are you," "what's up," "how's it going," and "how's your day."

3. If the user input does not match any predefined greetings or questions, the chatbot provides a default response.

4. To exit the chat, type "exit."

## Code Explanation

- The code begins by defining lists of greetings, questions, and corresponding responses. These lists can be expanded to include more greetings and responses.

- The `generate_response` function processes user input, converts it to lowercase for case insensitivity, and selects an appropriate response based on the input.

- The main loop starts the chatbot and continuously waits for user input.

- The user can type "exit" to terminate the chat.

- The chatbot generates responses using the `generate_response` function and displays them to the user.

## Sample Usage

To run the chatbot, execute the `main.py` script. Here's a sample interaction:

```
Chatbot: Hello! I'm a simple chatbot. You can start a conversation with me or type 'exit' to end the chat.
You: Hi
Chatbot: Hello! How can I assist you?
You: How's it going?
Chatbot: I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but thanks for asking!
You: What's your favorite color?
Chatbot: I'm not sure how to respond to that. Can you please rephrase your question?
You: Exit
Chatbot: Goodbye!
```

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot by adding more greetings, questions, and responses. This basic structure can serve as a starting point for creating a more sophisticated text-based AI chatbot with additional features and functionality.
